## üåê Running the Website Locally
### üêã Docker Container
Ensure docker is installed on your system. Then run the following command:  
```docker run --name CityWatch -p 41062:80 kaviv23/citywatch:latest```

After the container has been created, **wait another 10 seconds before visiting the website for the first time**:  
http://localhost:41062/www/CityWatch/home.php

### üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation
To run the website locally on your system manually, you will need [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) installed on your system. Then, place [this repository](https://github.com/KaviV23/CityWatch/) into XAMPP's htdocs folder. For example:

If XAMPP is located at `C:\xampp`:
>C:\xampp\htdocs\CityWatch\

Then, open up XAMPP and start up the Apache and MySQL service.  
When running this project for the first time, you will also need to initialize the database. First create a new database named ```CityWatch``` and then import [`CityWatch-database.sql`](/CityWatch-database.sql) into it through [phpMyAdmin](http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin/) (make sure MySQL is running).

Finally, you will be able to access the website at http://127.0.0.1/CityWatch/home.php
